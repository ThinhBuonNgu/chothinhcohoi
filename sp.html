	<h5>Support</h5>
	<p>The Support role in League of Legends is often misunderstood by newer players, but it is one of the most impactful and strategic positions in the game. Unlike other roles that focus on farming minions, dealing damage, or securing objectives directly, supports thrive by enabling their teammates, controlling vision, and dictating the flow of the game through map awareness and crowd control. A skilled support player can completely change the outcome of a match by making smart plays, protecting their carries, and setting up winning engagements.<br>Supports are primarily stationed in the bot lane, where they partner with the ADC (Attack Damage Carry) to provide sustain, utility, and protection during the early laning phase. Their job isn't just to babysit their ADC but also to control the lane, zone enemies, and set up kill opportunities with crowd control abilities. Many supports excel at peeling, meaning they use their abilities to prevent enemies from diving onto their carries, ensuring their ADC can deal sustained damage safely in fights.<br>A huge aspect of playing support effectively is vision control. Warding the map properly, clearing enemy vision, and tracking the enemy jungler's movements provide invaluable information to the team. The Support Item Quest grants free wards, which allows supports to place Stealth Wards and, later, upgrade to Control Wards or Oracles Lens to deny enemy vision. This vision control is what often determines the outcome of dragon fights, Baron setups, and mid-to-late game teamfights. A support who understands how to control vision can single-handedly secure game-winning plays without ever needing to deal high amounts of damage.</p>
